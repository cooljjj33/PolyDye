# PolyDye Full Color 3D Printer Mod

![PolyDye Full Color 3D Printer Mod](https://www.level9000.co.za/images/PolyDyeHeading.jpg)

The **PolyDye Full Color 3D Printer Mod** brings vibrant, full-color printing to Marlin-based printers by integrating inkjet printing technology directly into your 3D printer workflow. This modification applies ink layers between white filament layers to color your model.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** The software is currently in **beta**, and this repository is **not yet complete**. Expect frequent updates and experimental features. We will be adding the rest of the files over the next month or 3...

## Credits

This project would not have been possible without the contributions of the following individuals and organizations:

1. **Jeroen Domburg** - For his hack on HP 803 inkjet cartridges where he provided pinouts and sample code that served as a foundation for this mod. A portion of the sales go to his tip jar. 
2. **Adafruit** - Their research and work on hacking the LCD interface of the ESP32-S3 interface.  
3. **Bianca Mariani** - Thanks to my loving wife for putting up with me during the four years of developing this mod, editing the videos and soldering tiny components when I couldn't see anymore.
